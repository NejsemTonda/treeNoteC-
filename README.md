# TreeNote - A Tree Structure Note-taking Application

![](https://github.com/NejsemTonda/treeNote/blob/main/src/showcase1.png)

## Motivation

I wanted to create an app where I would be comfortable making notes. I didn't like the fact that I don't have any perspective in my notes, and when I write them in one file, I often get lost in them. I really liked the tree-like structure of the notes, like in Obsidian.md. I wanted to use Vim as a text editor because it suits me the most of all text editors. But I didn't find any application that suited me perfectly, so I decided to create my own.

### How to Run

1. Copy all files from the project to the folder in which you wish to take notes.
2. Run this command: `dotnet run --init`
3. Run this command: `dotnet run`
4. Open `edit.md` (or any other file extension) in your favorite text editor.

### Controls

- Click on the node you wish to edit. The currently loaded node should be highlighted with a different color.
- Hover the mouse over the node you wish to see its thumbnail.
- Click and drag on the background to shift all nodes.
- Click and drag on a node to move the node and its children.
- Ctrl+click on the background to create a new node.
- Ctrl+click on a node to create new children of this node.
